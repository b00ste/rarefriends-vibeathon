Your Rare Friend leads a tetromino space station: build paths, assign workers, fight rival commanders and contest four shared monoliths.

## Play

Connect a wallet holding an eligible **hardwired Generations Friend, generation 1 or later**, on **Robinhood mainnet (chain 4663)**. FriendSDK verifies ownership and supplies the selected Friend's canonical artwork and animations. The Friend is your playable commander, with movement, work, construction, combat, healing, Shield and EMP abilities. Commander selection is optional before play; the full-screen collection lets you inspect and change Friends.

- **Friends & AI:** up to four commanders total, any mix of humans and Easy/Normal/Hard AI. Enter the sector, share the room code from Menu → Match & invitations, and begin once everyone joins. Each commander builds a separate station on one shared battlefield.
- **Online PvP → Find practice match:** free automatic one-versus-one matchmaking. The second player starts the match; invite another tester if the queue is empty.
- **Win:** hold all four shared monoliths uncontested for 60 seconds, or be the last surviving core. Friends must walk there on completed paths; rival Friends/guards can contest ownership. Enemy bases remain hidden until explored.

The linked submission mode renders the game at **960×640 logical pixels**, scales uniformly and letterboxes to fit. The normal demo URL also offers a responsive full-window layout for phones and large monitors. Both use the same simulation. No installation is required.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard / pointer / touch |
| --- | --- |
| Build | B or Build icon → block 1–7 / I,O,T,L,J,S,Z → building 1–8 → click/tap a connected tile |
| Adjust blueprint | R rotates; Backspace returns to blocks; Escape clears; touch buttons provide equivalents |
| Workers | W or worker icon; recruit, then +/− assign to jobs |
| Friend | Click/tap a room to work, completed flooring to move, or a visible enemy to attack; arrows also move |
| Abilities | Q Shield, E EMP; icon buttons on touch |
| Combat mode | Single-figure/group icons toggle Friend/free workers between Peaceful and Aggressive; assigned building staff stay at work |
| Camera | Drag to pan, wheel/pinch or +/− to zoom; center button returns to base |
| Settings | Menu: sound, reduced motion, dock location, instructions, invitations and forfeit |

Buildings cost alloy, workers cost alloy and food, and abilities spend energy. Unfinished cancellation refunds 100%; completed dismantling removes its tiles and refunds 75%. Your units walk clear automatically before removal, and a connected route to your core must remain. Enemy-destroyed buildings leave walkable wreckage and refund nothing.

## Costs, rewards and wallet safety

**This submitted MVP is free and simulated.** Alloy, food and energy have no on-chain value. Custom and practice matches take no deposits and pay no tokens. The displayed future 1 RF entry / 2 RF prize mode is disabled on mainnet. Experimental escrow/referee contracts and local-chain tests are included in the source; they are not deployed or independently audited. The SDK chance-game schema is unused scaffolding; no purchase/reward action is exposed.

## Implementation and running locally

FriendSDK **v0.1.2**, RainbowKit/wagmi, React 19, TypeScript, Canvas 2D, and a server-authoritative Node simulation. Unmodified FriendSDK package provenance and third-party notices are included. The SDK iframe sandbox and identity bridge remain intact; a bounded host relay handles multiplayer and read-only canonical sprite requests. The backend filters fog of war and validates costs, construction, paths, combat and results.

Node 22.18+ (24 recommended):

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4173/?submission=1`. This needs a Node backend; static hosting alone is insufficient. `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run check` and `npm run build` provide the core checks. The repository documents browser tests, contracts and runtime settings.

## Validation and known limitations

See the source repository's `docs/LIVE-PLAYTEST.md` for live four-session evidence and `docs/VALIDATION.md` for the broader regression history. Browser tests emulate wallets and canonical NFT RPC responses while using the real game server; they do not impersonate real assets in the deployed app. Physical iOS/Android wallet handoff and gameplay remain unverified.

The latest seven-minute four-browser stress run completed with 230 buildings, 256 workers and 486 commands, without game, page or HTTP errors. Authenticated event streams replaced polling after an earlier run exposed the development proxy's request limit. A separate live match verified shared capture, contesting, combat and an agreed winner. The public beta now runs on dedicated AWS resources with game and API domains, HTTPS, persistent match snapshots and private backups. The [current source review](https://github.com/b00ste/farfield/pull/1) includes the deployment and latest validation record. Larger player counts remain unverified.

Early access: heuristic AI and human balance need more playtesting. Free matches checkpoint every five seconds and on graceful shutdown; a crash may lose changes since the last checkpoint. The same tab can recover its seat after a reload and wallet/Friend revalidation. Closing the tab or switching devices does not preserve a practice seat. Online absence beyond 60 seconds forfeits while a rival is active. This is a single-server beta without automatic failover or an uptime guarantee. Real-device wallet switching remains unverified.
